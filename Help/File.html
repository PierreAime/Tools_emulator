The File Menu provides functions for file manipulation that can be used to 
manage the options and functionality of the editor software. The submenus of 
the File Menu are listed below, along with a description of each.<BR><BR>

<B>New</B><BR>
New creates a new course for editing. The default course is one with 4 control 
points situated at predefined locations, Mute City venue, No ROM Music, Mute 
City Expansion Kit Music, no Horizon elements, pink Sky and default 
Name/Description texts. This function is called when the program loads.<BR><BR>

<B>Open...</B><BR>
Open prompts you to select a .fzep file that was created with the editor. Once 
selected, the file will be loaded into the editor and editing can take place 
from there.<BR><BR>

<B>Save</B><BR>
Save writes the current course data in the editor to the most recently used 
file. If no file was selected via Open or Save As, the Save As function is 
called. Be careful not to accidentally overwrite course files.<BR><BR>

<B>Save As...</B><BR>
Save As prompts you to give a name for a .fzep file to be created using the 
course data currently being used within the editor software.<BR><BR>

<B>Select Input ROM...</B><BR>
Select Input ROM prompts you to select a ROM file that specifies any F-Zero X 
ROM image in V64 or Z64 format. A proper header is required, and some 
functional ROM images include an incorrect identifier. The editor software will 
notify you of any problems once you attempt to load a ROM image. After a ROM 
file is selected, the Load Course from ROM and Load Textures from ROM submenus 
are enabled.<BR><BR>

<B>Load Course from ROM...</B><BR>
Load Course from ROM opens a special window that you can use to extract a 
course from the ROM for editing in the software. This submenu is only active 
after a ROM image is selected via the Select Input ROM submenu.<BR><BR>

<B>Load Textures from ROM</B><BR>
By default, the program loads no textures into memory. This is done 
deliberately; not to be hindersome, but to give the user more control. Load 
Textures from ROM will extract the textures stored in a given F-Zero X ROM file 
and use them in the 3D preview. Edited textures will be reflected in the 
Preview window thusly. This software cannot edit textures. The Load Textures 
from ROM submenu is only active after a ROM image is selected via the Select 
Input ROM submenu.<BR><BR>

<B>Load Textures from File...</B><BR>
By default, the program loads no textures into memory. This is done 
deliberately; not to be hindersome, but to give the user more control. Load 
Textures from File will prompt you to select a .tex file that contains usable 
texture data for use in the 3D preview. Only .tex files created with this 
software are guaranteed to work. Loaded textures will be reflected in the 
Preview window thusly.<BR><BR>

<B>Save Textures...</B><BR>
Save Textures prompts you to specify a filename to dump the loaded texture data 
to a .tex file. The Save Textures submenu is only active after textures have 
been loaded into the software.<BR><BR>

<B>Exit</B><BR>
Exit will close the program and all open windows. All unsaved work will be lost 
and you will not be prompted to save. Window settings will be saved 
automatically when the program exits.
