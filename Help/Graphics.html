Graphics Settings Window

The Graphics Settings window specifies how graphics are to be drawn in the 
Preview Window. The following features are provided:<BR><BR>

<B>Page Selector</B><BR>
At the top of the window are three boxes, one labeled "Gridlines", another 
labeled "Polygons" and the other labeled "Features." This is the page selector, 
which will allow you to view more properties within the same window. Simply 
clicking on these boxes will present you with the approperiate page of 
properties.<BR><BR>

<B>Gridlines</B><BR>
Gridlines are non-polygon objects drawn to the Preview Window as lines. They 
can be antialiased and assigned colors as HTML triplets. Checking the box next 
to their name determines if they are drawn.<BR><BR>

<B>Track Surface</B><BR>
The polygons that make up the track can be hidden or shown by unchecking and 
checking this box.<BR><BR>

<B>Venue Floor and Tunnel Exteriors</B><BR>
Both of these options can be made transparent and the percent of transparency 
can be set. Venue Floor is the plane beneath the course and Tunnel Exteriors 
are the polygons that represent the outside of Tunnel and Pipe track 
segments.<BR><BR>

<B>Segment Distance</B><BR>
This is the maximum distance two spline points can be from each other when 
generating track surface polygons. The smaller the value, the more polygons; 
and thusly the smoother the curves.<BR><BR>

<B>Clear Color</B><BR>
This is the overall color of the background when no polygons are drawn in any 
given part of the Preview Window. This color can be a predefined color made to 
match the color of the Sky property of the course, or a custom color specified 
in HTML triplet format.<BR><BR>

<B>Red Blinkers</B><BR>
At the ends of No Track segments, red, blinking caps are drawn to terminate the 
surface of the track. Unchecking this box will prevent these caps from being 
drawn to the Preview Window.<BR><BR>

<B>Sky Gradient</B><BR>
When checked, the Preview Window will draw the sky in much the same way that it 
will appear in the game. A Sky setting of Night will yield stars instead of a 
color gradient.<BR><BR>

<B>Horizon Images</B><BR>
When checked, Horizon Images will be drawn to the Preview Window. For more 
information on Horizon Images, see the <A HREF="CourseProps.html">Course 
Properties Window</A> page.<BR><BR>

<B>Animation Timer</B><BR>
The timer will make all motions in the Preview Window move according to how 
much time elapses between frames; such that the movement will be consistant to 
the human eye. Unchecking this box will make all animation occur at the 
maximum capabilities of your graphics adapter.<BR><BR>

<B>Texture Filtering</B><BR>
Specifies whether or not bilinear texture filtering should be applied. When 
unchecked, polygons can be rendered more quickly, but textues will be 
pixelated.<BR><BR>

<B>Wireframe Mode</B><BR>
When checked, this option will cause all polygons to be drawn in wireframe 
mode as opposed to being solid.<BR><BR>

<B>Features</B><BR>
Many elements that are drawn on and around the course may or may not be desired 
in the Preview Window. Checking and unchecking these boxes will determine 
whether or not the given Feature is drawn.
