The Element Properties Window allows you to manipulate all aspects of the 
course that pertain to the track surface where the race takes place. The 
following features are provided:<BR><BR>

<B>Page Selector</B><BR>
At the top of the window are three boxes, one labeled "CTL Point," another 
labeled "Segment" and the other labeled "Misc." This is the page selector, 
which will allow you to view more properties within the same window. Simply 
clicking on these boxes will present you with the approperiate page of 
properties.<BR><BR>

<B>Current Control Point</B><BR>
This drop-down box allows you to select which Control Point of the course to 
modify. If display of Control Point Dots is enabled, the currently-selected 
Control Point will be marked with a large, rainbow-colored dot in the Preview 
Window.<BR><BR>

<B>Coordinates</B><BR>
The X, Y and Z coordinates of the currently-selected Control Point can be 
changed in two ways. One way is to edit the values directly in the text fields 
labeled approperiately. The other way is to click and drag with the mouse in 
the boxes to the left of the text fields. Changes are immediately reflected in 
the Preview Window.<BR><BR>

<B>Width</B><BR>
Same as Coordinates, except the changes affect the left- and right-side widths 
of the course at the selected Control Point.<BR><BR>

<B>Banking</B><BR>
Same as Coordinates and Width, except the changes affect the banking 
(counter-clockwise from upright) in degrees of the course at the selected 
Control Point. Values will automatically wrap around 0&deg; and 
360&deg;.<BR><BR>

<B>Decorations and Structure</B><BR>
Sets what kind of Gate, Structure or other Decoration will show up at the 
selected Control Point. For Structure, options are provided to determine if the 
given structure will appear on the Left side, Right side, or none at 
all.<BR><BR>

<B>Drag Speed</B><BR>
Sets the movement ratio for the Click and Drag controls, in units per pixel. 
It will cause a change of the specified number of units every time the mouse 
moves one pixel while dragging.<BR><BR>

<B>Add Point and Remove Point</B><BR>
Creates or removes Control Points. Points will be added between the 
currently-selected Control Point and the next Control Point, and the 
currently-selected Control Point will be deleted. There cannot be fewer than 4 
Control Points and there cannot be greater than 64 Control Points.<BR><BR>

These two buttons exist on both the CTL Point page and the Segment 
page.<BR><BR>

<B>Current Segment</B><BR>
Identical to Current CTL Point. This only exists on the Segment page for your 
convenience.<BR><BR>

<B>Base Appearence</B><BR>
These controls specify the look and behavior of the track segment. The Type 
drop-down list specifies the track type. Texture changes which texture is 
applied to the segment. Changes are reflected in the Preview Window as you 
make them.<BR><BR>

Only Normal, No Track or same-type segments can be connected directly. That is, 
a Pipe segment can't connect to a High-wall segment, but you can join them by 
placing a Normal segment in between.<BR><BR>

<B>Segment Length</B><BR>
Statistical informaiton specifying the length, in meters, of the 
currently-selected segment.<BR><BR>

<B>Make #1</B><BR>
This button will make the currently-selected segment the first in the course; 
moving all other control points and properties relatively. This is useful for 
Expansion Kit course creation when you want to move where the Lap Line is 
located.<BR><BR>

<B>Features</B><BR>
This collection of drop-down applies the stated property to the 
currently-selected segment. Properties that can be applied are Pit Area, Dart 
Zone, Slip Zone, Dash Plate, Jump Plate and Trap Field. Zones cannot overlap 
each other, so values will be changed accordingly as you edit. That is to say, 
a Pit Area set to Both Sides cannot coexist with a Dart Zone set to the Left 
side, so setting the Dart Zone thusly will overwrite Pit Area so that it only 
exists on the Right side.<BR><BR>

<B>New Point Segment Offset (%)</B><BR>
Specifies the percentage of the distance from one Control Point to the next to 
create a new Control Point. Values range from 10.0 (near the currently-selected 
Control Point) to 90.0 (near the next Control Point). Of course, 50.0 will 
create a new Control Point halfway between the currently-selected Control Point 
and the next Control Point.<BR><BR>

<B>Rotate</B><BR>
This feature will rotate the coordinates of all Control Points the specified 
amounts around the center of the course. Give values for the Azimuth, Elevation 
and Skew angles, then apply the rotation with the Rotate button.<BR><BR>

<B>Line-Up</B><BR>
This feature will arrange Control Points from a starting point to an ending 
point such that they will all be colinear. The Equidistant check box will make 
all points the same distance from each other, where leaving it unchecked will 
have all Control Points retain their relative distances from each 
other.<BR><BR>

The From and To Control Points wrap around the end of the course, so for a 
64-point course, selecting From 62 and To 4 will work as though Control Points 
1 through 4 were situated <I>after</I> Control Point 64.<BR><BR>

<B>Scale</B><BR>
This feature will scale the coordinates of the course's Control Points a given 
Factor from the center of the course. Give a value for Factor, then apply the 
scale by clicking the Scale button. Checking the Scale Course Width check box 
will resize the Width properties of the control points the given Factor; 
whereas they would not be altered otherwise.<BR><BR>

<B>Translate</B><BR>
This feature will translate the coordinates of all Control Points the specified 
amounts from their current position. Give values for the X, Y and Z 
coordinates, then apply the translation with the Translate button.<BR><BR>

<B>Center Track</B><BR>
This feature applies a special Translate command that will center the track in 
the field given by Extremes (see below). The lowest Y coordinate of the course 
will match the Minimum Y Extreme, and the minimum/maximum X and Z coordinates 
will be the same distance from the Minimum and Maximum X and Z 
Extremes.<BR><BR>

<B>Make Friendly</B><BR>
These two buttons will do what they can to modify the course in order to make 
it conform to the ROM Friendly and EK Friendly rule sets. If they are unable to 
correct Friendliness, you will be prompted as to why. For more information on 
ROM Frienliness and EK Frienliness, check the <A HREF="CourseProps.html">Course 
Properties</A> page.<BR><BR>

The only notable change that these functions might make is that the EK Friendly 
button will change specific graphics settings if the course Venue is set to GP 
Ending. If it is, the venue will be changed to Sector, all segments of type 
Normal - Venue Texture 1* will be changed to Normal - Venue Texture 2* and all 
segments of type Normal - Venue Texture 2* will be changed to Normal - Venue 
Texture 1*, with the exception of Venue Texture 2C.<BR><BR>

<B>Extremes</B><BR>
This feature sets the Minimum and Maximum values for any coordinates that you 
can use for Control Points. Changing these values will change any 
non-conforming coordinates of Control Points. To reset the values to those 
used by the Expansion Kit, click the Use Default button.
