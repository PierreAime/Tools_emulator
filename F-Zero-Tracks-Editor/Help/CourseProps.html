The Course Properties Window displays an editable collection of properties that 
describe the track as a whole; not just individual parts. The controls on this 
Window are as follows:<BR><BR>

<B>Page Selector</B><BR>
At the top of the window are two boxes, one labeled "Track ID" and the other 
labeled "Misc." This is the page selector, which will allow you to view more 
properties within the same window. Simply clicking on these boxes will present 
you with the approperiate page of properties.<BR><BR>

<B>Text and Description Boxes</B><BR>
The boxes labeled "Name," "Description" and "Japanese Description" are special 
controls for text entry that allow you to input text as it will appear in the 
game. Click on a box to set focus, and use the keyboard to type normal 
text.<BR><BR>

Only in the Description boxes can lowercase letters "c," "r" and "s" be used. 
Hold SHIFT to input these. Other characters that are not available on the 
keyboard can be inputted by selecting them from the Special Characters box. 
The Japanese Katakana ideographs can only be inputed into Description fields, 
and the Greek letters can only be inputed into the Name field.<BR><BR>

<B>Source</B><BR>
The Source box documents where the track came from. This is where you should 
put any credits, including copyright notices.<BR><BR>

<B>Music</B><BR>
The Music boxes are used to select which music should play during gameplay on 
the given course. There are two drop-down menus; one for ROM and one for 
Expansion Kit. There are different selections in each due to each software's 
ability to play musics.<BR><BR>
